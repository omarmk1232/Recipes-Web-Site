        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Real talk: who among us is actually able to resist a delicious Little Debbie snack cake? We know we can’t. When we see an oatmeal creme pie or Christmas tree cake, we can’t stop ourselves from digging in.

            Even though we know Little Debbie bakes each cake for us with love and care, there’s no denying that homemade recipes are always that much better. That’s why the geniuses in our test kitchen took everything you know and love about a Cosmic Brownie—from the fudgy brownie to the sweet ganache and candy pieces—and made it just a little bit better. Yes, that’s actually possible.
            
            Because our mouth is already watering looking at the gooey, chocolatey brownies, here’s how to make them yourself.</p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sweet Dough</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cream Cheese Filling</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Egg Wash</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Icing</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Whisk in buttermilk and heat until an instant-read thermometer reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Beat egg mixture into flour mixture on medium-low speed until a firm, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. If dough doesn't separate from the sides of the mixing bowl during kneading, beat in up to 1/4 cup more flour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the outside edge of an 8-inch cake pan.
            </li>
